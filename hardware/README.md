Swervo Hardware
===============

The main goal for the hardware design is simplicity, and use of COTS parts, at the expense of, well, expense.
There are two fabricated parts:

* The base, made of [Owens Corning Foamular 150](https://www.owenscorning.com/en-us/insulation/products/foamular-150), an inexpensive lightweight rigid polystyrene foam which is [available locally](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Project-Panels-FOAMULAR-1-in-x-2-ft-x-2-ft-R-5-Small-Projects-Rigid-Pink-Foam-Board-Insulation-Sheathing-PP1/203553730) in small quantities in one-inch thickness.  It's resilient enough to serve as a bumper b ut strong enough to carry the rest of the parts.
* The module brackets, which are 3d-printed PLA.

Everything else is COTS, see the BOM.

There are Fusion 360 designs for both the [base](https://a360.co/3N4E435) and the [bracket](https://a360.co/3GCei3N), and also for the [module assembly](https://a360.co/3a7XJ3m) and the [full assembly](https://a360.co/3wX9a7f).

Hardware TODO's:

* The motors are expensive, constituting about half the system cost.  Consider alternatives?
* Steering could be faster, and the steering gears are expensive.  Consider alternatives for steering.  Printed gears?
* 6-channel slip rings are a few dollars cheaper than 12-channel, and would work, combining +/- wires for both motors.
